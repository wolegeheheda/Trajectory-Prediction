# lstm
This repo features a minimal lstm implementation for people that are curious about lstms to the point of wanting to know how lstm's might be implemented.  The code here follows notational conventions set forth in [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00019)well written tutorial introduction.  
this article should be read before trying to understand this code (at least the part about lstm's). 

By running `python test.py` you will have a minimal example of an lstm network learning to predict an output sequence of numbers in [-1,1] by using a Euclidean loss on the first element of each node's hidden layer.
